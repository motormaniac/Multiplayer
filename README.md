# multiplayer
A technical demo for an online multiplayer .io game

- TODO list
- [ ] Add the webpack module (module manager)
- [ ] Add the express module (for ui)
- [ ] Add babel (allows html to work on older versions)

- IMPORTANT:
- only modify the typescript files
- Always run compile.bat after editing ( run "./compile" if in client directory or "client/compile" in multiplayer directory)

- Making the .env file:
- Make a file named ".env"
- The .env file holds all the private information specific to the local machine such as what port to use
- The .env has these current variables (copy the same variables and formatting but just replace the contents):
-   PORT = #port number (integer)
